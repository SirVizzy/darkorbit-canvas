# Darkorbit Canvas

> **Disclaimer:** This project is a personal exploration and learning exercise. All assets and intellectual property related to DarkOrbit are owned by their respective creators and are used here for educational purposes only.

Welcome to my first attempt at creating a game! This project is a super simplified version of my favorite childhood game, DarkOrbit. It's designed to recreate some of the scaffolding of the original game, using the HTML5 canvas element instead of Flash.

## Goals
- Improve engineering skills
- Expand knowledge of canvas
- Dip toes into game development
- Enjoy the nostalgic journey

## Features
- To be determined. As development progresses, expect features like map navigation, player interactions, and dynamic environments.
